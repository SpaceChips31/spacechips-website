      <p><strong>Chips</strong><br>
      Driven by logic, caffeine, and side quests.</p>

      <p>
        I’m a programmer and hardware technician based in Italy — nerdy by default, a little weird by design, and methodical by necessity.
        By day, I work with code and components. By night, I dive into 3D modeling, play the drums, prototype tools I may never finish,
        or just follow whatever rabbit hole my brain decides to chase that day.
      </p>

      <p>
        I created <strong>Spacechips</strong> to share the things that fascinate me — discoveries, small breakthroughs, strange ideas —
        and to hopefully build a space where people like me (and unlike me) feel welcome.
        I love the idea of being a kind of “tech mentor” for those who feel new to it all.
        I’ve been that person, looking for clear guides and finding only scattered docs or noise.
        So I decided to write the kind of content I wish I had when I started.
      </p>

      <p>
        Spacechips is also a tool for me — a way to keep myself grounded, especially when ADHD pulls me in 20 directions.
        It helps me stay focused, motivated, and connected to what I build.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most of what I share comes from tools I use in my daily work or experiments:
        Linux setups, hardware builds, visual tricks, and code patterns I’ve tested myself.
        Some of it might turn into tutorials, some into creative renders or blog entries powered by obsession and a good playlist.

      <h3>⚙️ Things I like (besides code):</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Music and drumming — loud rhythms make my brain happy.</li>
        <li>Puzzle kits, robot building, and DIY electronics.</li>
        <li>Sci-fi films, quiet walks with my dog, and that one Spotify playlist I keep looping like a ritual.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>🧭 What I care about:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Making complex things easier to understand.</li>
        <li>Being honest, curious, and always a bit offbeat.</li>
        <li>Helping people go from “I don’t get this” to “I’ve got this.”</li>
      </ul>
